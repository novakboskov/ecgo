reping constantly pings the set of IP addresses and records the RTTs in termporary
files. In parallel, it periodically incorporates the termporary files into the
single output file that is useful for analysis. Ping sends an ICMP ECHO_REQUEST
each second.

Do not pass the same IP address multiple times. You will get only one single result.

Usage: ./reping.sh [-c] -o OUTPUT_FILE -p PERIOD IP_1 [IP_2 ...]

Parameters:
  IP_1 [IP_2] are the IP addresses to ping.

Options:
  -o file where the results will be stored.
  -p time interval to refresh the output file cumulatively.
  -c clean the artifacts of previous reping runs.

IP addresses in OUTPUT_FILE are modified. Any dots are replaced with dashes.

CAUTION: This program is designed to save disk space but is by no means optimal.
Given that:
- P is the period to refresh output file (e.g., 1 minute) (PERIOD),
- disk(P) is the file size that a call to ping produces in P,
- T is the multiple of P that tells how long we run this program for, and
- N is the number of IP addresses to ping.
Then the required disk space is 2*N*T*disk(P).
For example, for N=128, P=1m, T=60, and disk(P)=700B, we need 11MB of disk space.
That is, we will likely reach 1GB of disk space in 4 days of running this program.

A common usage patern is:
timeout --signal 9 1445m ./reping.sh -o my_output.dat -p 1h google.com yahoo.com

This will ping google.com and yahoo.com each second over one day and
refresh statistics each hour. The extra 5 minutes passed to the timeout command
are to give the statistics combinator some extra time to complete its task.
